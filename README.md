## Kidney Disease Classification using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict **Kidney Disease** using machine learning classification algorithms.  
It uses medical data to classify whether a patient is affected by kidney disease or not.



##  Project Description

Kidney disease is a critical health condition that requires early diagnosis.  
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze patient medical records and classify kidney disease efficiently.

The system performs:
- Data preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature analysis
- Model training and evaluation

---

##  Objectives

- Analyze kidney disease dataset
- Preprocess and clean the data
- Train classification models
- Evaluate performance using accuracy and metrics
- Predict kidney disease status

---

##  Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

---

##  Dataset Details

The dataset contains medical attributes such as:

- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Specific Gravity
- Albumin
- Sugar
- Blood Glucose Random
- Serum Creatinine
- Hemoglobin

**Target Variable:**  
- `ckd` – Chronic Kidney Disease  
- `notckd` – No Kidney Disease

---

##  Technologies Used
